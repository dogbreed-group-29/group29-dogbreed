## App Overview (Description and Evaluation)

**App Name:** DogBreed Gallery

**App Description:**
DogBreed Gallery is an Android application designed to help users explore, learn about, and visually browse various dog breeds. Using the Dog CEO API, the app displays a scrollable gallery of dog images categorized by breed. Users can search and filter breeds with ease, making the app both educational and fun for dog lovers.

Initially, our team attempted to build a weather forecasting app using the OpenWeatherMap API. However, due to recurring issues with API keys, data fetching inconsistencies, and parsing problems, we reevaluated our direction. After exploring multiple ideas‚Äîincluding a Pok√©mon API viewer‚Äîwe settled on DogBreed Gallery due to its straightforward data structure, reliable public API, and immediate visual engagement.

We evaluated our ideas based on:
- **API reliability and ease of integration**
- **Visual appeal and user engagement**
- **Feasibility within the milestone timeframe**

DogBreed Gallery scored highest in all categories, allowing us to focus on solid UI/UX and functionality.
